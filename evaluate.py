# In this file, implement evaluation functionality:
# - Load a trained DQN model
# - Run multiple episodes without exploration (epsilon=0)
# - Record metrics like:
#   - Total episode rewards
#   - Average reward
#   - Episode lengths
#   - Win/loss statistics for Ice Hockey
# - Optionally create visualization of gameplay
# - Save evaluation results
#
# This file will be used to assess the performance of your trained agent
# and provide insights into how well it has learned to play Ice Hockey.
